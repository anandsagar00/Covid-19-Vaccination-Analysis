# Covid-19-Vaccination-Analysis and prediction

This is an Exploratory Data Analysis project using Our-World in dataset , where I have tried to figure out how different vaccines performed in different countries .

What were the reasons of the least vaccinated countries , and many other things the related ppt can be found in the repository which contains some of the analysis which we presented as our course project.


I have also tried to predict the count of daily vaccine in a given country on a given date using Stacked LSTM model
