# Covid-19-Vaccination-Analysis and prediction

## Situation:
During the second semester of my academic program, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a lockdown, and I found myself in my hometown, Bhagalpur, Bihar. I was eager to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, but I encountered a significant challenge. Whenever I checked the Arogya Setu App to schedule a vaccine appointment, I consistently encountered unavailability, as vaccines were often out of stock.

## Task:
I decided to take the initiative and conduct an in-depth analysis of COVID-19 vaccination data using the Our-World dataset. My task was to investigate how various vaccines were performing in different countries. I aimed to understand why some countries had low vaccination rates and identify potential strategies to improve vaccination rates.

## Action:
To address this challenge, I collected and analyzed data from the Our-World dataset. I examined the performance of different vaccines in various countries and identified the factors contributing to low vaccination rates. My analysis involved looking into the availability and distribution of vaccines, as well as the reasons behind low vaccination rates in specific regions.

I also implemented a predictive model, specifically a Stacked LSTM model, to forecast the daily vaccine counts in a given country on a particular date. This model aimed to assist the responsible authorities in predicting the future vaccine requirements accurately, enabling them to manage vaccine stock effectively and ensure that everyone could receive their vaccination according to a schedule.

## Result:
As a result of my project, I gained valuable insights into the performance of various vaccines in different countries. I identified the reasons behind low vaccination rates and proposed strategies to improve vaccination rates. Moreover, the implementation of the Stacked LSTM model allowed for the accurate prediction of daily vaccine requirements, which could be instrumental for authorities in efficiently managing vaccine distribution and ensuring widespread vaccination coverage.
