(Wo Balck and white heat map wale ke liye hai)

#this heat map tells us if the occurrence of missing values are sparsely located or located as a big chunk
#example in female_smokers we see that there are bigger chunks of missing values where as in total_cases we 
#see that data is missing in very less amount that too very far from each other
#where as in total_vaccinations we see that data is missing in larger chunks very frequently

We can also see if two columns have almost same number of missing values at same index then we can also verify it using 
Heatmap-null-coorelation Matrix
