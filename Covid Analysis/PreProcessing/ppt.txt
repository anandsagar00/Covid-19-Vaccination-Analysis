As we can see that before the data was highly skewed (13.50),
due to which a very high % of data was segregated towards a particular value due to which many values were treated as outliers
So we took log of the column after adding 1 to each value of the column to remove skewness,and now we can see that the data has better
distribution now (skewness=-0.3)
